## Welcome

This University of Arizona themed presentation was developed by the [CCT Data Science](https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/) team at University of Arizona.

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Sample Slide

Here's a bulleted list:

-   First item

    -   sub item

-   Second item

Here's a numbered list:

1.  First item
    1.  Sub item
2.  Second item

## Custom logo

To override the logo in the lower right corner, you can add your own in the YAML header

``` yaml
---
title: "The title of my talk:"
subtitle: "Also has a subtitle"
author: "Your Name"
date: last-modified
format: 
  uaz-revealjs: 
    logo: mylogo.png
editor: visual
---
```

Just make sure the image file (in this example "mylogo.png") is in the same folder as your presentation.

## Logo size

To adjust the size of the logo, create a `custom.scss` file with the following content

``` scss
/*-- scss:defaults --*/
$logo-height: 3.5rem;
```

and adjust the number

Include this style in your YAML header:

``` yaml
---
title: "The title of my talk:"
subtitle: "Also has a subtitle"
author: "Your Name"
date: last-modified
format: 
  uaz-revealjs: 
    theme:
      - custom.scss
editor: visual
---
```

# Section Break

Use the level 1 header for a section break slide

## Blockquotes

The theme includes custom blockquotes

> Women belong in all places where decisions are being made.
> It shouldn't be that women are the exception.
>
> \- *Ruth Bader Ginsburg*

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.

You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(ggplot2)
1 + 1
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) + geom_line()
m <- lm(hwy ~ class, data = mpg)
```

Here's a formatted but unevaluated code block

``` r
print("Hello!")
```

## Code with output

output is by default below code

```{r}
#| echo: true
print("Hello")
```

But can also be on the side

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
print("Hello")
```

## "Fenced" Code

If you're teaching about Quarto or RMarkdown, it's helpful to show the whole code chunk, including options.
That's pretty easy with the `echo: fenced` chunk option:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: false
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cyl)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  theme_bw()
```

## Code Output

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(dplyr)

starwars %>% 
  mutate(name, bmi = mass / ((height/100)^2)) %>% 
  select(name:mass, bmi)
```

## Equations

Here are some equations:

$$
y = \alpha_i + \beta_1x_1
$$

This is an inline equation $e = MC^2$

## Multiple columns
